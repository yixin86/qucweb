obligations. When you engage us to provide services for you, we will
be the “data controller” for your personal data.</p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">This policy explains how we collect, use, process, manage and disclose personal data within
our organisation.</p>
<p class="pp-title"><strong>Explaining the legal basis we rely upon to process your personal information</strong>
</p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">Data protection laws set out various grounds on which an organisation may lawfully collect
and process your personal data. These include:</p>
<p class="pp-terms-text"><em>Consent</em></p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">We can collect and process your data with your consent. For example, when we are processing
sensitive or special personal data, such as information relating to your health or religious beliefs. In many
circumstances, if we rely on your consent as our legal basis
for processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.</p>
<p class="pp-terms-text"><em>Contractual obligations</em></p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">In many circumstances, we require your personal data to comply with contractual
obligations. For example, we collect your identity and contact information when we verify you as a new
customer. If you are unable to provide such information to us, we may
not be able to perform the contract we have with you or your organisation or enter into a contract with you or
your organisation.</p>
<p class="pp-terms-text"><em>Legal compliance</em></p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your personal data. For
example, we may require your personal data to comply with
anti-money laundering legislation or laws relating to the provision of legal services. If you are unable to
provide such information to us, we may not be
able to perform the contract we have with you or your organisation or enter into a contract with you or your
organisation.</p>
<p class="pp-terms-text"><em>Legitimate interests</em></p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">In many situations, we require your personal data to pursue our legitimate interests in a
way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact on
your rights, freedoms or interests. For example, it may be in our
legitimate interests to use your personal information for marketing purposes to assist us with the growth of our
business.</p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">Data protection laws do vary across the different jurisdictions in which we operate. Please
contact us if you require details of the specific legal ground
we are relying on to process your personal data.</p>

<p class="pp-title"><strong>What are your rights over your personal data?</strong></p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">You have a number of rights in relation to the personal data that we hold about you. These
rights are subject to certain exemptions and do differ across
the jurisdictions in which we operate.</p>
<em>Request access to the personal data we hold about you</em>
<p class="pp-terms-text">If you want to access any of the personal data that we hold about you or to correct some
aspect of it (for example, because you think it is incomplete or incorrect), please contact our privacy
compliance team using the contact details set out below. To protect
the integrity and security of the information we hold, we may ask that you follow a defined access procedure,
which may include steps to verify your identity. In certain cases we
may charge you an administration fee for providing you with access to the information you have asked for, but we
will inform you of this before proceeding. There may be cases where
we are unable to provide the information you request, such as where it would interfere with the privacy of
others or result in a breach of confidentiality. In these cases we
will let you know why we cannot comply with your request.</p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">Even if you do not request access to and/or correct your personal data held by us, if we
are satisfied that, having regard to the reasons for
which we hold your personal data, that personal data is inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date, irrelevant or
misleading, we may take reasonable steps to correct that information.</p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">For EU residents, we will do this for no fee, in accordance with applicable legislation.
</p>
<em>Right to rectification </em>
<p class="pp-terms-text">If the information we hold about you is inaccurate, you have the right to have this
information rectified.</p>
<em>Right to erasure / ‘Right to be forgotten’</em>
<p class="pp-terms-text">You can ask us to delete or remove your information in certain circumstances. For EU
residents, whenever you have given us your consent to use your
personal data, you have the right to change your mind at any time and withdraw that consent. In cases where we
are processing your personal data on the basis of
our legitimate interests, you can ask us to stop processing your data for reasons connected to your individual
situation. We must then do so unless we believe we have a legitimate
overriding reason to continue processing your personal data.</p>
<em>Right to data portability</em>
<p class="pp-terms-text">In certain circumstances, you may have the right to obtain your personal data in a
structured, commonly used and machine readable format and to reuse it elsewhere or ask us to transfer it to a
third party of your choice.</p>
<em>Right to object</em>
<p class="pp-terms-text">In certain circumstances, you have a right to object to processing being carried out by
us. Where personal data is being processed for direct marketing
purposes, you have a right to object at any time</p>
<em>Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling</em>
<p class="pp-terms-text">In certain circumstances, you have a right not to be subject to a decision which is based
on automated processing where the decision will produce a legal effect or a similarly significant effect on you.
</p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">To protect the confidentiality of your information, we will require you to verify your
identity before proceeding with any request. If you have authorised a
third party to submit a request on your behalf, we will ask them to prove they have your permission to act.</p>
<p class="pp-title"><strong>Complaints</strong></p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">We try to meet the highest standards in order to protect your privacy. However, if you are
concerned about the way in which we are managing
your personal data and think we may have breached any applicable privacy laws, or any other relevant obligation,
please contact our privacy compliance team using the contact details set out below. We will make a record of
your complaint and refer it to our internal
complaint resolution department for further investigation. We will
deal with the matter as soon as we can, and keep you informed of the progress of our investigation.</p>
<p class="pp-title"><strong>Changes to this policy</strong></p>
<p class="pp-terms-text">We may make changes to this policy from time to time, to take into account changes to our
standard practices and procedures or where necessary to comply with new laws and regulations. The latest version
of this policy will always be available on our
website.</p>
